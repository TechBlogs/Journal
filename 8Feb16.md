I was at our College's MUN conference last night. It spanned over Saturday and Sunday. I was the delegate of
United Kingdom in the League of Nations. The setting was January, 1945, the agenda being "Post World War 2 re-building of
Europe and deciding whether to make reforms in the existing League of Nations or establish a new international organiation for
maintaining world peace known as the 'United Nations'".

The hall our committee sat in was a spacious, brightly lit room with wooden furniture. It was divided into 3 sections - the
Center which directly faced the Chair person's desk, and the left and right sections. I sat at the back of the center section,
directly in sight of the chair.

Sitting at the upper-left corner of the right section of the room, in white Kurta-Payjama was the delegate of Poland. I was
told he was a last minute entry - that I had to be careful about him, for he was highly experienced - a power player.

Then the conference started.

I was unquestionably at my best. I had recognized the patterns in MUN politics, strategies, research insights and public
speaking styles from the experiences of the 6 MUNs I had attended thus far. Poland, I was told, had attended about 22.
It never seemed to be the case. He used to speak very less. He would get up once about every 10 minutes or so. What I did
realize was that every single sentence out of his mouth made sense. He meant business. He wasn't like a lot of other
pretentious 20-somethings who just suited up and came to the MUN for selfies and checking people out. I didn't think much
of him, I was busy with devising my own speeches and strategies. He seemed nothing like an MUN-er.

Him and I sat through the lunch time in our hall, devising the draft resolution. I only realized the cunning character that he was when he began to question the reslution he was a sponsor of. At the end, he also submitted a few amendments, one of which we had to accept as friendly.

At last, the conference ended. I was nervous. I didn't take part to learn. I aimed only and only for the Best Delegate award.
I have this tendency to always wanting to prove to myself that I am competitive and capable of beating the best. I crossed my
fingers. I waited as the awards were being announced, my palms sweating, eyes uneasy, heart pounding.

Let's just say, for a dramatic effect, that I closed my eyes. A chill ran down my spine and as I opened my eyes, I saw
some of my friends looking at me, smiling upon the Chairs' announcement.

I had got the High Commendation award.

The next award to be announced was the Best Delegate, and within that split second, I knew who bagged it. The only person who,
I knew instantly, was more capable and deserving than me - The delegate of Poland. He took away from me the only thing I
worked for in the past week.

The High Commendation is basically the 2nd prize in MUN conference. For a moment, I detested the guy. But then I realized
that even though I got tagged as the Beta like Eratosthenes, I had taken back with me a much bigger picture of the world.

I had heard before that Hard Work is no substitute for experience. Yesterday, I experienced it first-hand and this idea is
now engraved into my mind.
I also realized that underestimation is a force that sucks you in deep and just when you begin to fall in love with it, it
spits you right back out.
But most of all, I respected, for the level of assholery he pulled off, the delegate of Poland.

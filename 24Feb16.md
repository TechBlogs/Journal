In my honest opinion, LinkedIn is a complete Fuck up (This is the perspective of a lot of customers).
Not because of the management, I adore Hoffman and his team, the idea is brilliant and monetization strategy is cool.
However, it is the people on Linkedin, most of which are simply polluting this "Professional Space" by sharing pointless
mathematical, logical or spatial puzzles with tag lines "99% of the people can't do it" and shit like that.

Then there are people who sit there posting inspirational quotes. The theory behind this is to stick a motivational
sentence or 2, accompanied by a name like Richard Branson or Mahatma Gandhi and you have the most profound-sounding
quote of the century.
This kind of stuff does a really good job of portraying the idiocy that drives most people, who are simply incapable of
differentiating between Facebook and LinkedIn. I've seen some PR & HR people post photographs from parties and events
saying "Hi frnzz, pls add me here". A deeper look at such things conveys the intensity with which these people are basically
yelling that they're desperate for some attention and are already bored with FB, so LinkedIn maybe? The funny thing is, a lot
of people do, in fact, add such people and also comment "Hi, you're lookin beautiful". Dude..?

Lastly, there is a gigantic army of fake recruiters. They'll go to the extent of preying on the Job Seekers' passion /
desperation to find new opportunities for gaining traction on their profiles.

All that is good about LI basically boils down to the 1% of people who either keep a low profile or are really very
professional in their approach, because that is exactly what Linkedin is meant for. Not your daily gossip / puzzles or whatsapp
joke doses.

Grow up People.

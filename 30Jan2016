You know how there has always been an intense argument the rationalists present about how "free will" is not truly free? That we make our own choices out of our own will is just an illusion, and the truth is that our brains have been moulded over the years to think in specific ways (Sort of a 1984 situation)?
I recently read about an Experiment in which Researcher Professor Lawrence Williams was able to change people's opinions with the help of just a cup of coffee (and I can't even get my friend to bring me food :/).
But if that is the case, why do we still see the outliers? Why are there people who view this world from a completely different perspective and whose views may not align with those of the "common man"?
Personally, I think that we are in complete control of our thoughts. The only reason they are bent over time is because we allow (and in fact, force) them to.
The reasons for this could be many. For starters, there is the Reward & Punishment Theory. When we change our thinking to comply with that of the authority's, we are rewarded. If we choose to rebel instead, we are punished.
There is also this nasty bug hard-wired inside almost every brain - its called Peer Pressure. We may be afraid to be left out of the group because our beliefs do not match theirs.
So what is the driving force behind those outliers who refuse to bend their thought process to comply with society?
I think being a psychopath helps. Psychopaths have been found to be risk takers, simply because the thought of consequences of failiure does not worry them. They may not truly understand the gravity of the situation and that is what drives them to make risk-taking decisions, and they often benefit from them.
Psychopaths make great Entrepreneurs.

I don't believe in being humble.

Alright, let me explain that. Humility is an ideal quality to have and I've always been filled with joy every time I've interacted with someone who is really humble.
The lack of an arrogant and condescending character makes you ever more comfortable to speak with such people, and you develop a personal connection with them.
When it comes to talking about your skill set or achievements, your work ethic or struggles, modesty obviously serves the speaker well.
But it serves their audience very poorly.
I've often wanted to know more about certain highly accomplished individuals that I find on Twitter / Linkedin / Quora.
A lot of other people, like me, want to know about things like their daily routine, their productivity strategies, achievements in their youth and so forth.
In such scenarios, the best picture can only be given if the person in focus is absolutely 100% honest about themselves.
However, this is often not the case.

Take for example:
Question by a curious person: "How did JOE BLOGS teach himself convolutional neural networks in High School? Isn't it quite difficult to grasp?"

A typical, humble JOE BLOGS would answer: "Its not true that I taught myself. I had a lot of help.
I had mentors who were always willing to guide me.
I was also very lucky to have my Math Teacher explain the mechanics of Backpropogation Algorithm to me, 
which helped me build my basics."

Excellent JOE! Your modesty really won us over. Here, take 2K upvotes for your answer.
But where does this leave our poor curious friend, who isn't enlightened in any way?
I have struggled. Taught myself a whole lot of things. Yes, I'm thankful to have mentors too.
But mentors guide you, its you who has to go through hell and back to master a skill. Practice. Intense Practice.
Mentors cannot give you that.

So, I know what JOE really did to become who he is. He sat through the nights, reading, googling, talking to experts,
practicing critical thinking questions, writing code, revisiting and fixing it, waiting for responses,
waiting for results, dealing with frustrations, determined to not give up.
JOE forged a path for himself that led him to the expertise that he attains today.

So dear JOE, when someone is genuinely interested in knowing more about a certain part of you,
please express yourself to the fullest without the humility. Humility only misleads people.
The accurate truth will simply make them respect you more, because they will end up enlightened and simply wiser!
